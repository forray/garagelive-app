<h4>Sharing of your personal information</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy (including our Cookies Policy).
<br/>
There are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal information we collect about you or which you provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:
</dt>
<dd>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments will be available to all users of the Platform.</dd>
<dd>With your consent: We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. We will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information.</dd>
<dd>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third parties to implement appropriate organizational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorized disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</dd>
<dd>Users of our API: GarageLive has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when deciding what information to publish on your profile. For information on how to limit the information that is available over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</dd>
<dd>Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your GarageLive account to other apps or social networks such as Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or networks. In the case of Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post or listen to on GarageLive or any new favorites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and friends on those networks. In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full access to your GarageLive account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favorite or repost sounds from within the app. This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private sounds. GarageLive is not responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect your account with apps or services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that your share, and how to disconnect your account from other networks or apps, please see the Choice and Control section below.</dd>
<dd>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third parties or make publicly available. However, none of this information would include any email address or other contact information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.</dd>
<dd>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</dd>
<dd>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the GarageLive community.</dd>
<dd>In the context of a business transfer: We may transfer your personal information to any person or company that acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of GarageLive, or on a merger of our business, or in the event of our insolvency.</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Cookies and similar technology</h4>
<p>
In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the Website and the Apps and Services we provide. We have included information about our use of cookies and similar technology in a separate Cookies Policy that forms part of this Privacy Policy. The Cookies Policy also includes information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform), and how to opt out of other technologies such as bug reporting within our mobile apps.
<br/>
<br/>
We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar technology. If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other technologies as described in our Cookies Policy, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal information that we collect using these technologies.
</p>
<h4>Choice and Control</h4>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to us, and the control you have over that information. It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a GarageLive account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<h4>Email preferences</h4>
<p>Check out the Email tab within your Account settings page on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can access your Settings by clicking on the cog wheel at the top of the screen, and selecting Account settings from the drop down menu.</p>
<dl>
<dt>From the email tab you can tell us:</dt>
<dd>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us; and</dd>
<dd>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the Account page within your Settings. This will immediately disable all email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform. It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications) at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<h4>Sharing with other apps and networks</h4>
<p>The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your GarageLive account. If you sign up for GarageLive using your Facebook or Google+ account, your GarageLive account and your Facebook or Google+ account respectively will be connected automatically. Information regarding the public sounds that you post, listen or favourite on GarageLive, will be shared with the connected Facebook or Google+ account. Content that you share with Facebook will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. Content you share with Google will be seen by the people from your Google+ circles when they visit your Google+ profile, make relevant Google searches, on Google-served ads, and the services selected in your Google account settings. If you do not want this information shared with Facebook or Google, please change your</p>
<h4>Settings</h4>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications before sharing your information with, or connecting your GarageLive account to, any of these third party sites or applications.</p>
<h4>Sharing with other users</h4>
<p>
GarageLive is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website. By checking this box, other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.
<br/>
<br/>
If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.
</p>
<h4>Sharing with app developers</h4>
<p>GarageLive has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</p>
<h4>Cookies</h4>

<h4>App preferences</h4>
<p>You can use the settings within our iOS device or within the Android app to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug reporting. For the opt-out, if you are using our iOS app, go to the settings of your iOS device and open the GarageLive tab. With an Android device you need to open the GarageLive app and open the basic settings tab within. From there you can simply disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics data or bug reporting information being sent from the app. Further information is available in our Cookies Policy.</p>
<h4>Deleting your account</h4>
<p>
You can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings on the Website at any time. Please bear in mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.
<br/>
<br/>
Even if you delete your GarageLive account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search engines' caching processes are outside of GarageLive's control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.
<br/>
<br/>
Please note that deleting any GarageLive Apps, or any third party apps to which your GarageLive account is connected, will not delete your GarageLive account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your GarageLive account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third party app.

<p>GarageLive is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance with European laws.
