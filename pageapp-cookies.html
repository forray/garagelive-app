                <h2>GARAGELIVE COOKIE POLICY </h2>
<p>
In common with most other websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to help us understand how people use GarageLive so that we can keep improving our Platform. We have created this Cookies Policy to provide you with clear and explicit information about the technologies that we use on GarageLive, and your choices when it comes to these technologies.
<br/>
<br/>
If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling cookies or opting out of other technologies, you will indicate your consent to our use of these cookies and other technologies and to our use (in accordance with this policy and the rest of our Privacy Policy) of any personal information that we collect using these technologies. If you do not consent to the use of these technologies, please be sure to block or disable them using your browser settings, the opt-out links identified in this policy, or the settings within our mobile apps.
</p>
<h3>What are cookies?</h3>
<p>
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. These text files can be read by these websites and help to identify you when you return to a website. Cookies can be “persistent” or “session” cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer when you have gone offline, while session cookies are deleted as soon as you close your web browser.
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3>GarageLive Cookies</h3>
<p>We use our own cookies to recognize you when you visit our website or use our apps. This means that you don’t have to log in each time you visit, and we can remember your preferences and settings.</p>
<h3>Third Party Cookies</h3>
<p>In addition to our own cookies, we work with various reputable companies to help us analyze how the Platform is used, and to optimize our Website and Apps to deliver the best possible experience. The following companies help us achieve this through use of cookies:</p>
<h3>Google Analytics and Google Website Optimizer</h3>
<p>
Google Analytics and Google Website Optimizer are services provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how users use our website, our mobile site and any GarageLive players embedded on third party sites. Google Web Optimizer uses the same cookies to measure how different users respond to different content. The information generated by these cookies (including your truncated IP address) is transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your, and other users’, use of our website, mobile site and GarageLive players, compiling reports for us on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. Please note that Google only receives your truncated IP address. This is sufficient for Google to identify (approximately) the country from which you are visiting our sites or accessing our players, but is not sufficient to identify you, or your computer or mobile device, individually.
<br/>
<br/>
Google cookies are those beginning “__ut”. You can find more information here, including a link to Google’s privacy policy. To opt out of this analysis by Google, please see the Opting Out section below.
</p>
<h3>Similar Technologies</h3>
<dl>
<dt>In addition to cookies, we also use the following standard Internet technologies in connection with your use of the Platform:</dt>
<dd>Clear GIFs: We use “clear GIFs”, sometimes known as “web bugs”, which are small image files that we embed into our email newsletters. These clear GIFs tell us whether you opened the newsletter, clicked on any of the content or forwarded the newsletter to someone else. This provides us with useful information regarding the effectiveness of our email newsletters, which we can use to ensure that we are delivering information that is relevant to our users.</dd>
<dd>Flash cookies: We use Flash cookies to synchronize information between multiple GarageLive players. This ensures that one player is stopped when another player starts. We do not use Flash cookies for the purposes of collecting any personal data, and do not use Flash cookies to respawn any cookies that you might previously have deleted.</dd>
<dd>HTML5 Local Storage: We use HTML5 local storage to store your default listening volume (i.e. the volume at which you prefer to hear sounds on GarageLive) and, in the case of premium users, to set the widget control color. If you access the mobile version of our website, we use HTML5 local storage to store certain cookie data, including your user plan, authentication data, your username and your display preferences. We do not use HTML5 local storage to collect any personal data or to track your activity on our websites.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Opting Out</h3>
<p>We think it’s important that you are able to control the collection of personal data relating to your use of GarageLive, and have therefore made sure that you can opt out of any personal data collection using cookies or other technologies as set out below. (Please note that you cannot opt out of our use of Flash cookies or HTML5 local storage as these are necessary for the technical operation of the platform. However, we do not use these technologies to collect any personal data.)</p>
<h3>Cookies:</h3>
<p>You can use the settings within your browser to control the cookies that are set on your computer or mobile device. However, please be aware that cookies are important to many aspects for the Platform – if you set your browser to reject cookies, you may not be able to enjoy all of the features of the Platform. To find out how to see what cookies have been set and how to reject and delete cookies, please visit http://www.aboutcookies.org.</p>
<h3>Clear GIFs:</h3>
<p>Clear GIFs are included in our email newsletters. You can unsubscribe from our newsletters at any time by following the link in the newsletter itself, or by changing your email preferences within your Settings in your GarageLive account.</p>
<h3>Activity Tracking and Bug Reporting:</h3>
<p>You can use the settings within our iOS device or within the Android app to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug reporting. For the opt-out, if you are using our iOS app, go to the settings of your iOS device and open the GarageLive tab. With an Android device you need to open the GarageLive app and open the basic settings tab within. From there you can simply disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics data or bug reporting information being sent from the app.</p>
<h3>Consent to Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>
<p>We have done our best to provide you with clear and comprehensive information about our use of cookies and similar technologies. If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling cookies or opting out of these technologies (as described above), you will indicate your consent to our use of these cookies and other technologies and to our use (in accordance with this policy and our Privacy Policy) of any personal information that we collect using these technologies. If you do not consent to the use of these technologies, please be sure to block or disable them using your browser settings, the opt-out links above, or the settings on your mobile device.</p>
